## Prompt

The user requested to proceed with the implementation of Module 4, following the same task structure as previous modules, and to generate the history.

## Response snapshot

I have completed all the tasks for Module 4 of the book "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics". This includes:
- Researching and outlining all three chapters (Foundations of Vision & Language in Robotics, Developing VLA Policies for Robotic Action, Case Studies & The Future of VLA).
- Drafting the full content for all three chapters.
- Developing code examples where appropriate (with N/A for theoretical chapters or those with complex project setups).
- Integrating the content and code into the Docusaurus website structure (including placeholders for diagrams/media and notes about code examples).
- Performing a review of all generated content.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Module 4 is now fully drafted and ready for further review and integration. The Docusaurus site now contains the three chapters of Module 4, completing the core content of the book.
- 🧪 Tests: All content and code examples were manually reviewed for accuracy and clarity.
- 📁 Files: 4 files were created or modified (3 chapter files, 1 code example file).
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to the Final Phase: Polish & Deployment tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The completion of Module 4 marks a significant milestone. The VLA concepts were well-integrated, and the approach of using conceptual code examples and placeholders for media proved effective for this module's theoretical nature.
